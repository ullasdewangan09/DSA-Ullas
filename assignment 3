Q.11 Mr. Ram is developing a software application to manage his
inventory, which initially can hold a maximum of ten product
packets. He allocates memory for ten packets at the start.
However, as the market demand changes, he needs to dynamically
update the allocated memory to store more or fewer packets
without wasting memory or running out
of space. Explain the concept of dynamic memory
allocation and how Mr. Ram can effectively
manage his inventory size using this concept.

C code 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int initial_size = 10; // Initial size of inventory
    int new_size;
    int *inventory;

    // Allocate memory for initial inventory
    inventory = (int *)malloc(initial_size * sizeof(int));
    if (inventory == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Initialize inventory
    for (int i = 0; i < initial_size; i++) {
        inventory[i] = i + 1; // Example initialization
    }

    // Print initial inventory
    printf("Initial inventory:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < initial_size; i++) {
        printf("Packet %d: %d\n", i + 1, inventory[i]);
    }

    // Change the inventory size dynamically
    printf("Enter new inventory size: ");
    scanf("%d", &new_size);

    // Reallocate memory to new size
    inventory = (int *)realloc(inventory, new_size * sizeof(int));
    if (inventory == NULL) {
        printf("Memory reallocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Initialize new packets if size increased
    if (new_size > initial_size) {
        for (int i = initial_size; i < new_size; i++) {
            inventory[i] = 0; // Example initialization
        }
    }

    // Print updated inventory
    printf("Updated inventory:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < new_size; i++) {
        printf("Packet %d: %d\n", i + 1, inventory[i]);
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    free(inventory);

    return 0;

        printf("Weight of treasure %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &weights[i]);
    }

    // Calculate the total weight
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTreasures; i++) {
        totalWeight += weights[i];

Q.13 Consider an object Shape that encompasses both a Square
and a Rectangle as the data members. The Square object should
have an attribute for its area, while the Rectangle object
should have attributes for length and breadth. Identify the
most suitable data structures for this scenario and write a C
program to define the structure and demonstrate their usage.

Code :

#include <stdio.h>

// Define the structure for Square
struct Square {
    int area;
};

// Define the structure for Rectangle
struct Rectangle {
    int length;
    int breadth;

    // Create an instance of Shape
    struct Shape shape;

    // Assign values to the square's area and rectangle's dimensions
    shape.square.area = 25;         // Example area of square
    shape.rectangle.length = 10;    // Example length of rectangle
    shape.rectangle.breadth = 5;    // Example breadth of rectangle

    // Perform an operation: Calculate and display the perimeter of the rectangle
    int perimeter = 2 * (shape.rectangle.length + shape.rectangle.breadth);
    printf("Square Area: %d\n", shape.square.area);
    printf("Rectangle Length: %d, Breadth: %d\n", shape.rectangle.length, shape.rectangle.breadth);
    printf("Rectangle Perimeter: %d\n", perimeter);

Q.17 (b) (i) Illustrate how asymptotic notations can be used to
analyze an algorithm? (6Marks)
(ii) Calculate time and space complexity for the
following code (6Marks)
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
int i = 1, sum = 0, n;
while (i<= n){
i=i+1;
sum = sum +i;
}}

solution:

(i) Asymptotic Notations for Analyzing an Algorithm (6 Marks)
Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to describe the
behavior of an algorithm in terms of time and space as the input size
grows. These notations allow us to analyze the efficiency and
scalability of algorithms by focusing on their performance in the
worst-case, best-case, and average-case scenarios.
The most commonly used asymptotic notations are:
1.Big O Notation (O):
Represents the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It
gives the worst-case scenario, describing the maximum time an
algorithm can take.
Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of
O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2), it means that the running time increases
quadratically with the input size.
2.Omega Notation (Ω):
Represents the lower bound of an algorithm's running time. It
gives the best-case scenario, describing the minimum time an
algorithm can take.
Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n)Ω(n)Ω(n),
it means that in the best case, the running time increases
linearly with the input size.
3.Theta Notation (Θ):
Represents the tight bound of an algorithm's running time. It
gives both the upper and lower bounds, indicating the exact
growth rate of the algorithm's running time.
Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(nlog⁡n)Θ(n
\log n)Θ(nlogn), it means that the running time grows at a rate
proportional to nlog⁡nn \log nnlogn for all cases.
Little o Notation (o):
Represents a stricter upper bound than Big O. It shows that an
algorithm's growth rate is strictly less than the rate described
by the function.
Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of
o(n2)o(n^2)o(n2), it means that the running time grows slower
than n2n^2n2, but it doesn't exactly grow at n2n^2n2.
Little Omega Notation (ω):
Represents a stricter lower bound than Omega. It shows that an
algorithm's growth rate is strictly greater than the rate
described by the function.
Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of ω(n)ω(n)ω(n),
it means that the running time grows faster than nnn.
(ii) Time and Space Complexity of the Given Code
#include<stdio.h>int main() {
int i = 1, sum = 0, n;
while (i <= n) {
i = i + 1;
sum = sum + i;
}
}
Time Complexity:
Initialization:
The initialization of variables i = 1, sum = 0, and n takes
constant time: O(1)O(1)O(1).
While Loop:
The while loop runs until i exceeds n. The loop's body executes
for each value of i from 1 to n.
Each iteration of the loop has two operations:
i = i + 1; takes constant time: O(1)O(1)O(1).
sum = sum + i; takes constant time: O(1)O(1)O(1).
Therefore, the total time taken by the loop is the number of
iterations multiplied by the time for each iteration, which is
O(n)O(n)O(n).
Overall Time Complexity:
The overall time complexity of the code is O(n)O(n)O(n).
Space Complexity:
Variables:
The variables i, sum, and n are all integer variables that
occupy a constant amount of space: O(1)O(1)O(1).
No Additional Data Structures:
The code does not use any additional data structures like arrays
or dynamic memory allocation that would require extra space.
Overall Space Complexity:
The overall space complexity of the code is O(1)O(1)O(1), as the
space required does not depend on the input size nnn.

Q.18(a) Given a number ‘n’, write an algorithm and the
subsequent ‘C’ program to count the number of two-digit prime
numbers in it when adjacent digits are taken. For example, if
the value of ‘n’ is 114 then the two-digit numbers that can be
formed by taking adjacent digits are 11 and 14. 11 is prime but
14 is not. Therefore print 1.

Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Function to check if a number is prime
int isPrime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) return 0;
    if (num <= 3) return 1;
    if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) return 0;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
        if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Convert the number to a string to process adjacent digits
    char str[12]; // Assuming a maximum of 10 digits in the number
    snprintf(str, sizeof(str), "%d", n);

    int count = 0;
    int length = strlen(str);

    // Extract two-digit numbers and check for primality
    for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
        int num = (str[i] - '0') * 10 + (str[i + 1] - '0');
        if (isPrime(num)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    // Print the count of prime two-digit numbers
    printf("Number of two-digit prime numbers: %d\n", count);

    return 0;
}
1.Prime Checking Function (isPrime):
  This function determines if a number is prime. It efficiently
  checks for factors up to the square root of the number,
  improving performance over a naive approach.
2.Main Function:
  The number n is read and converted to a string for easy processing of digits.
  Adjacent pairs of digits are extracted and converted into twodigit numbers.
  Each two-digit number is checked for primality using the isPrime function.
  The count of prime numbers is maintained and printed.
Time Complexity:
  Time Complexity: O(m⋅sqrt(k)) where m is the number of adjacent
  digit pairs and k is the maximum two-digit number (99).
  Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the string
  representation of the number.

Q.18(b) Demonstrate the usage of list and perform all
the possible operation using array with suitable
examples.
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored at
contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow us to perform various
operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.

1. Creation and Initialization
Code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Create and initialize an array of integers
    int arr[10] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // The first 5 elements are initialized

    // Printing the array
    printf("Array elements: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

2. Insertion
Code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[10] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int n = 5;  // Current number of elements
    int position = 2;  // Position where the new element will be inserted (0-based index)
    int value = 25;    // New value to insert

    // Shift elements to the right
    for(int i = n; i > position; i--) {
        arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
    }

    // Insert the new element
    arr[position] = value;
    n++;  // Increment the size of the array

    // Printing the array after insertion
    printf("Array after insertion: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

3. Deletion
Code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[10] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int n = 5;  // Current number of elements
    int position = 2;  // Position of the element to be deleted (0-based index)

    // Shift elements to the left
    for(int i = position; i < n - 1; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
    }

    n--;  // Decrement the size of the array

    // Printing the array after deletion
    printf("Array after deletion: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

4. Traversal
Code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int n = 5;  // Number of elements

    // Traversing and printing the array
    printf("Array elements: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

5.Searching
Code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int n = 5;  // Number of elements
    int key = 30;  // Element to search for
    int found = 0;

    // Linear search
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(arr[i] == key) {
            found = 1;
            printf("Element %d found at position %d\n", key, i);
            break;
        }
    }

    if(!found) {
        printf("Element %d not found in the array.\n", key);
    }

    return 0;
}
